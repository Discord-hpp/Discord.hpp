# Discord.hpp
 A new lightweight and fast Discord API Library, to program C++ bots.

## About us
 Since we have seen that there are not too many C++ library, and mostly of them are not suitable for beginners, so we decide to make a new one.

## Contribution
 We're glad to have some supporters, so if you think you can support us please make a pull request or contact `Harshfeudal0001` on Discord :>

## Attention
 This respiratory is still under-development! We haven't done yet, and we're really need for help.
